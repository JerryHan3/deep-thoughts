我在此代表众多中国大陆的 Minecraft: Java Edition、Minecraft: Java & Bedrock for PC、Minecraft(Android)、Minecraft(iOS)等一系列由微软及Mojang运营的所有Minecraft游戏（以下简称Minecraft国际版，以与由网易公司代理的我的世界中国版区分）玩家，请求微软公司和Mojang工作室立刻终止上海网之易吾世界网络科技有限公司对于Minecraft游戏在中国大陆的代理权，原因是网易公司擅自窃取社区作者创造的模组等原本免费的附加内容并盈利、无厘头打压社区创作者制作的针对Minecraft国际版的启动器、以搭建私服的名义起诉在中国大陆内运营Minecraft国际版服务端的服主并促使司法机关对其处罚，严重破坏Minecraft社区的自由度、打压创作者的创作热情。

I'm here to represent most China Mainland players of the series of Minecraft games maintained by Microsoft and Mojang (including *Minecraft: Java Edition*, *Minecraft: Java & Bedrock for PC*, *Minecraft*(Android), *Minecraft*(iOS), hereinafter called *Minecraft International Edition* to distinguish from *Minecraft China Edition* agented by NetEase), request Microsoft Inc. and Mojang Studio to revoke NetEase's agent role of *Minecraft* in China Mainland immediately. Here are the reasons: NetEase steals lots of free addons from international creators, such as mods, and uses them to make profits; they crackdown 3rd-party launchers for the *Minecraft: Java Edition* from creators in China Mainland unreasonably, and indict a server poster who was hosting *Minecraft International Edition* server in China Mainland for "hosting private server", and even **lead him to be punished by judiciary**. These actions have severely disrupted the freedom of the Minecraft community in China, and discouraged Chinese creators’ passion. 

## 我们为什么请求撤销网易的代理权？ | Why we request to revoke NetEase's agent role? 
原因就是上面这3点：窃取社区创作者的创作成果、打压第三方Minecraft国际版启动器、无理起诉Minecraft国际服服主。

The reasons are the 3 points mentioned before: Stealing great works from community creators, crackdown third-party launchers for *Minecraft International Edition*, and indicting a server hoster of Minecraft International Edition for “hosting private servers”. 

### 这些扩展是你的吗？ | Are these add-ons yours? 

Minecraft拥有相当丰富的社区附加内容，包括模组、资源包、等等。但是在网易开发的中国版有人直接擅自搬运或者稍加修改便重新发布了许多知名的模组和资源包。是否与原作者获得许可我不清楚，但他们将一部分内容声称是自己所有，甚至将本来完全免费的模组、资源包明码标价，从中盈利，其中不乏一些使用类GPL协议开源甚至完全闭源的模组或整合包！这种行为直接违反了原作者的许可协议！以下是我调查了解到的一些情况：

- 机械动力（MIT）→300钻石
- 暮色森林（修改过的GPL）→500钻石
- 僵尸启示录（闭源）→300钻石
- 逃逸：寄生虫（闭源）→300钻石
- 急救（GPL）→100钻石
- 幸运方块（保留所有权利）→100钻石
- Faithful（资源包，禁止盈利）→300绿宝石

其中，“钻石”需要以￥1=100钻石的比率购买，而“绿宝石”需要通过签到、参与活动等获取。

尽管上述内容显示是由集中的几个用户进行发布，但我怀疑这些用户实际上与网易有着密切的关系。即便没有这类关系，网易也并没有做好监管工作，按照国际通行的版权规则处理上述侵权内容，而是放任它们在中国版平台上长期存在。

Minecraft has various community contents, including mods, resource packs, etc. However, in NetEase’s *Minecraft China Edition*, some famous mods and resource packs are migrated without or with little modifications. I’m not clear about whether they have got permissions from original developers, but some of them claim that these contents are made by themselves, and even label price and make profits from them, while some of these contents use GPL-like licenses or close source! These behaviors are direct violence in the original licenses of these contents! Here are some examples I’ve discovered: 

- *Create* (MIT) -> 300 diamonds
- *Twilight Forest* (Modified GPL) -> 500 diamonds
- *Zombie Apocalypse* (Close source) -> 300 diamonds
- *Scape and Run: Parasites* (Close source) -> 300 diamonds
- *First Aid* (GPL) -> 100 diamonds
- *Lucky Block* (All Rights Reserved) -> 100 diamonds
- *Faithful* (Resource pack, Forbidden profit making) -> 300 emeralds

PS: "Diamonds" can only be purchased in ￥1=100 diamonds rate, and "emeralds" can be obtained by signing in or attending activities. 

Although the platform shows that these contents are published by a few users, I doubt these users have a close relationship with NetEase. Even though such a relationship doesn't exist, NetEase still fails to apply proper moderation to these contents that violate copyrights according to International copyright rules and lets them persist for a long time. 

### 无辜的启动器 | Innocent launchers

按照Minecraft的用户协议等相关政策，开发者可以开发辅助Minecraft运行的工具或插件，只要它们不让人们认为这是Mojang官方开发或者授权的内容。本次事件的主体BakaXL第三方启动器并没有违反这一规则。它的宣传视频原标题为“隆重介绍，你的下一个Minecraft启动器 &#124; BakaXL 3.0”，使用Minecraft名称只是为了表明自己所作用的对象是Minecraft，一般人均可看出这并不是Mojang开发或者授权的内容。但是，视频发布15多天之后，BakaXL的作者TT702便收到了视频下架的通知，原因是被网易举报侵权。这个启动器只是可以启动由Mojang直接运营的Minecraft Java版，与网易代理运营的Minecraft中国版没有丝毫关联。我们不禁发问，网易你有什么资格插手国际版Minecraft的相关事务？Mojang有给你授权吗？

According to Minecraft's EULA, developers can create assistant tools or plugins for Minecraft, just need to make sure that it doesn’t seem like Mojang’s official or authorized product. The core of this event, the *BakaXL* launcher, doesn't violate this rule. The original title of its promoting video was: *Introducing your next Minecraft launcher &#124; BakaXL 3.0*, and we can see the word “Minecraft” is only used for indicating it’s a tool for Minecraft, and normal people can realize that it isn't an official product. But after 15 days or more, the developer TT702 received the notice that his video had been taken down due to NetEase’s complaint of right violence. This launcher can only launch *Minecraft: Java Edition* maintained by Mojang, and has no relevance with NetEase’s *Minecraft China Edition*. We can’t help to inquire: NetEase, who are you to meddle in *Minecraft International Edition*’s business? Have you got Mojang's authorization? 

更出格的是，不久之后就传出来一位Minecraft国际版服务器服主被网易刑事起诉的消息，这令我们更加愤怒。我要再重复一遍上面的质问：网易，你有什么资格插手Minecraft国际版的事，有什么资格去管理Minecraft国际版服务器？本来国际社会对Minecraft 1.19.1加入聊天举报机制就已经十分不满，你凭什么说把服主抓走就把服主抓走？你说这是在开“私服”，这是你的私服吗？你一个Minecraft中国版的代理商跑过来对Minecraft国际版服务器指手画脚，你何德何能？！~~况且Minecraft的EULA说明Mojang允许大家使用Minecraft服务端架设属于自己的服务器，商业使用准则明确写出任何人均可使用Minecraft服务端进行有限范围内的盈利，而这位服主并没有违反该规则所规定不能做的事情，我想问网易你究竟读没读过Minecraft的EULA和相关条例？！~~*后续调查发现涉事服务器涉及利用付费内容换取破坏游戏平衡的内容，违反了Minecraft的EULA因此我收回上述被划掉的话。但这也令我们十分担心，网易会不会把手伸到所有中国的Minecraft国际版服务器上面。*

What's more unacceptable is, news says that a person hosting a server of *Minecraft International Edition* was penally indicted by NetEase, which makes us more furious. I repeat the previous inquirement again: NetEase, who are you to meddle in *Minecraft International Edition*'s business, and moderate *Minecraft International Edition* servers? The whole community has already been unsatisfied for the Chat Reporting added in 1.19.1, why you can arrest a server hoster with your one word? You said that this is a "private server", is this REALLY a private server of your game? You, an agency for *Minecraft China Edition*, come to spoil up *Minecraft International Edition* servers, HOW DARE YOU?! <del>Meanwhile, it's clearly clarified that anyone is ok to use Minecraft server software to host their own server in Minecraft EULA, and the Commercial Usage Guideline announced that anyone can use Minecraft server to earn profits in a restricted area, and that hoster didn't violate this guidline. I can't help to ask NetEase, have you really read Minecraft EULA and relevant terms?!</del> <i>More investigation shows that relative server did have "Pay-to-Win" contents, which violates Minecraft EULA, so I take back these deleted words. However, this event make us really worry whether NetEase will interupt all Minecraft International Edition Servers in China. </i>

### 逐步增长的野心和不明朗的未来 | Increasing Ambition & Unclear Future

现在，包括我在内的很多玩家都有这么一种看法，网易的行为是在越俎代庖，企图在中国大陆地区替代Mojang和微软的角色管理Minecraft的所有事务，将所有的中国玩家都逼到自己的Minecraft中国版之中，以从他们身上赚取更多的利益。它的野心已经初露面貌，所以我们很明确地说：痴人说梦！不要妄想以自己的野心去笼罩整个中国Minecraft社区，我们会与这种行为抗争到底！也希望微软和Mojang对此事予以高度重视，不要等到让网易失控的那一天！

Now, lots of players hold an opinion: NetEase is exceeding its authority, trying to override the role of Mojang and Microsoft in China Mainland, so it can manage all business of Minecraft, and force all Chinese players to play its *Minecraft China Edition* to make more profit from them. It's ambition gradually shows up, so we definitely say: You're DAYDREAMING! Stop trying to cover the entire Chinese Minecraft community under your shadow, we will fight against such behaviors to the end! I also hope Microsoft and Mojang can pay high attention to these affairs, before NetEase become uncontrollable! 

我们为网易的非人行为感到愤怒，同时也对中国Minecraft社区的未来感到担忧。我们如此喜爱Minecraft，就是因为它自由的游戏玩法和开放的社区环境。网易的上述行为，正在将中国的Minecraft社区拉入封闭的深渊，这令我们格外痛心，我们不忍心看到这样一个优秀的社区环境葬送在网易的手下。请允许我在此引用一段BakaXL作者TT702在视频被下架后发表的一段文章作结：

> Minecraft 的成功离不开社区的贡献和创造，作为一款激发用户创造力和想象力的沙盒游戏，Minecraft 社区的开放性、包容性正逐渐成为许多年轻一代开发者接触计算机编程的选择。<br/>
在网易公司代理“中国版我的世界”后直指位于国内的国际版 Minecraft 开发者侵权，令我们对 Minecraft 今后的未来感到担忧，这一个由社区、玩家、开发者和 Mojang Studio 一同打造的沙盒世界的未来，是否将会变得越来越封闭、黑暗且荒凉。 <br/>
BakaXL 作为一个并不出众的小众国际版 Minecraft 启动器都会遭遇如此对待，在网易公司这般运作下，国内下一个受到伤害的国际版 Minecraft 开发者又会是谁？网易是否能够及时踩下刹车，停止对国际版 Minecraft 社区的伤害？在失去了无数热爱着这款游戏的开发者之后，在国内的 Minecraft 玩家、开发者社区的未来又会走向何方？

We feel furious for NetEase's inhuman actions, and worry for the future of Chinese Minecraft community. Why we like Minecraft so much? Because of its free gameplay and open community environment. NetEase's above actions is dragging Chinese Minecraft community into the limbo of closure. This makes us really distressed, because we can't bear to see such awesome community environment get buried under NetEase's hand. Please let me translate a part of TT702(BakaXL's main developer)'s passage after his video was taken down as the end: 

> The success of Minecraft is inseparable from the contribution and creation of the community. As a sandbox game that inspires player's creativity and imaginations, the openness and inclusivity of Minecraft community is making it become the option for new developers to get familiar with computer programing.<br/>
After NetEase agented Minecraft China Edition, they indicate that Chinese developers for Minecraft International Edition is violating their rights, which makes us worry about the future of Minecraft. Will such a bright future for this sandbox game, contributed by both community, players, developers, and Mojang Studio, become close, dark, and desolate? <br/>
As a Minecraft International Edition launcher that is not that famous, even BakaXL has suffered such treatments. Under NetEase's maintainence, which Minecraft International Edition developer will become the next victim? Can NetEase stop its action in time, stop hurting the Minecraft International Edition community? After losing uncountable developers that love this game, where will the future of Chinese Minecraft players and developers' community go? 

## 我们需要什么？ | What do we Need?

我们需要微软和Mojang的反应，通过来自原有开发者的权力快速制止代理商网易的肆意妄为。依我拙见，行动如下：

1. 立刻撤销网易在中国大陆地区代理Minecraft的权力，收回他关于Minecraft游戏的一切权利。
2. 后续中国大陆地区的Minecraft游戏由微软公司直接运营。

如果我的提议过激，我也希望微软和Mojang采取任何快速有效的措施尽快制止网易公司的行为。本身网易的运营方案就违背了Minecraft的自由精神，这次它已经伤害到了我们玩家群体的切身权益。我们不能再对它忍气吞声。

We need Microsoft and Mojang's reaction, quickly stop NetEase's reckless behavior through your original developer's right. In my opinion, you can action like: 

1. Revoke NetEase's agent right of Minecraft in China Mainland immediately, and revoke all his right about Minecraft. 
2. Microsoft can directly maintain Minecraft in China Mainland. 

If my opinion is too aggressive, I desperately hope Microsoft and Mojang can take any fast and effective action to stop NetEase's behavior as soon as possible. The NetEase's operate method itself is breaking Minecraft's free circumstance, and this time it hurts our players' right directly. We can no longer stay silence.
